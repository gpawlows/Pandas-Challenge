Observation 1:  Based on the last table constructed, it appears that Charter schools are achieving better results
across the board than District schools.  They have pass rates in the 90s for both Math and Reading and an 
overall pass rate of 90.4%.  District schools on the other hand have pass rates of 66.5% and 80.8% for Math and 
Reading, respectively.  District schools have and overall pass rate of just 53.7%

Observation 2: Spending more per student doesn't equate to better outcomes.  In fact, the schools that were
in the lowest spending bucket, less than $585 per student show the highest pass rates.
